                   <h3>--> Why is giving to others important?</h3>
                   <p> Helping others is not only good for them and a good thing to do, it also makes us happier and healthier too. Giving also connects us to others, creating stronger communities and helping to build a happier society for everyone. And it's not all about money - we can also give our time, ideas and energy. </p> <br>
                   <br>

                   <h3>--> How do we use your valuable funds?</h3>

                    <p>We at spark foundation are extremely focused on ensuring that your contribution brings high impact and that the bulk of it is spent on funding programs. Our administrative costs at 12% are well below the Indian non-profit sector average, as we are extremely conscious of spending your money as effectively as possible. <br> <br>

                        Every donation received is an affirmation of your faith in us, and we are committed to maintaining the highest levels of accountability and transparency always.</p> <br>
